# neogCamp-levelZero-basic-quiz
 This repository contains neogCamp's lessonOne basic quiz app.

---

In this repository, I have used two `npm` packages for better user experience.

### First one is `readline-sync`

> Use `npm install readline-sync` to install

`readline-sync` is used to have a simple conversational UI in CLI applications. You can use it to ask user different types of questions and get answered. It supports many different types of question formats.

In this app, I have used the basic `question()` function.

### Second is `chalk`

> Use `npm install chalk` to install

`chalk` is used to stylize your CLI applications. Basic two color CLI apps is too common. We can use `chalk` to colorize our messages in the CLI app.

In this app, I have used three basic colors to different types of messages in different color.
