In this repository, I have used two `npm` packages for better user experience.

### First one is `readline-sync`

> Use `npm install readline-sync` to install

`readline-sync` is used to have a simple conversational UI in CLI applications. You can use it to ask user different types of questions and get answered. It supports many different types of question formats like YES/NO or MCQs or simple explaination questions. You can read more [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync).

In this app, I have used the basic `question()` function.

### Second is `chalk`

> Use `npm install chalk` to install

`chalk` is used to stylize your CLI applications. Basic two color CLI apps is too common. We can use `chalk` to colorize our messages in the CLI app. You can read more [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk).

In this app, I have used three basic colors to show different types of messages in different colors.
